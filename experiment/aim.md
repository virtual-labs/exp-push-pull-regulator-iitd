### To study the performance characteristics of DC-DC push-pull regulator in respect of:

##### a) Principle of operation followed by voltage-gain expression.

##### b) Effect of non-idealities (ESL, ESR, R<sub>DSON</sub>,V<sub>FD</sub>, R) on converter operation.

##### c) The loading effect on efficiency of the converter.

##### d) Voltage and current stress of components on device selection.
